## Project Overview:
- This project focuses on the automatic detection of cyber-bullying using a dataset compiled from various sources.

## Dataset:
- Description: A collection of datasets from different sources related to the automatic detection of cyber-bullying.
- Primary Dataset: Twitter_parsed tweets dataset.
- Objective: Classify whether a tweet is toxic or not.

## Approach:
- Data Collection:Compiled a diverse dataset of tweets from multiple sources.
- Data Preprocessing:Cleaned and preprocessed the tweets to prepare them for analysis.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP):Performed a step-by-step NLP approach to identify the toxicity of tweets.
- Feature Engineering:Extracted relevant features from the tweets for model training.
- Modeling:Applied Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models to classify the tweets.
- Classification:Classified the tweets into binary values (toxic or not toxic).

## Evaluation:
- Target Variable: Binary classification (toxic or not toxic).
- Evaluation Metric: F1-score to measure the accuracy of the model.
